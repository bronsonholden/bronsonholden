### Hello! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

My name is Bronson. I'm a web developer who gets hyped up on test-driven development, CI/CD, and pretty
much anything that makes the complex and sometimes frustrating job of creating software easier.
Aside from hacking on Rails apps, I'm into running (trying to run at least one marathon in my life),
competitive precision rifle shooting, and playing piano. My passive hobbies are sleeping and watching
thriller movies or D-tier romcoms.
