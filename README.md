### Hello! 🙋‍♂️

My name is Bronson. I'm a web developer who gets hyped up on test-driven development, CI/CD, and pretty much anything that makes the complex and sometimes frustrating job of creating software easier. When I'm not hacking away, I can be found cyling, running, or playing the piano.

* Elixir
* Ruby
* JavaScript & TypeScript

#### Frameworks I use

* Phoenix
* Ruby on Rails
* React & Next.js
