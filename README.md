### Hello! 🙋‍♂️ <img align="left" width="250" height="250" src="https://github.com/paulholden2/paulholden2/blob/main/octocat.gif?raw=true">

My name is Paul. I'm a software engineer focused mainly on web development and integrations. I'm also greatly interested in test-driven development, CI/CD, and pretty much anything that makes the complex and sometimes frustrating job of creating reliable and adaptable software a bit easier.

In my downtime, I like to fish 🎣 I use both conventional and fly gear, and even tie my own flies to let off some creative steam. Occasionally I'll play piano 🎹 or (on warmer days) go cycling 🚴‍♂️
